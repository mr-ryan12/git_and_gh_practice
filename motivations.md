Computer science and using technology to benefit others has always interested me. Although I enjoy my current field, (working with adults with developmental disabilities at a small local electronics recycling center) it serves as a stepping stone and reintroduced me to my interest in computer science. Learning and building new technologies to help others on a broader scale sounds like a great carrer path. It will be hard to leave, but I'm excited to see what lies ahead!
